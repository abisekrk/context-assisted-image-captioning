# “Let’s not Quote out of Context”: Unified Vision-Language Pretraining for Context Assisted Image Captioning



## Data
We constructed a dataset for the "Contextual Visual Entailment" task that was introduced in our paper.


The data can be downloaded from [here](https://iitbacin-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/21q050004_iitb_ac_in/Eu6lmwWo0PdKopPfOJ6ZePUBVmLqG8izfnYChvmZ0c2vCw?e=gVFGjI)

The dataset has tsv files with reference to images. To download the actual image files, you can refer to the Visual News image dataset [repository](https://github.com/FuxiaoLiu/VisualNews-Repository).
